Analyse the data set of a collection of cars, the objective is to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG). Find a conclusion to: 
 1 ."Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?" 
 2 ."Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(tinytex)
```
First Load data (mtcars) and prepare for analysis: Process the MPG and AM values for a mean of Automatic Transmission and Manual Transmission.
Then, run a linear regression to check which works better on miles per gallon (MPG). As statistical infenrence, run the t-test to confirm with confidence interval which transmission is more effective.
```{r data, echo=TRUE}
data(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
mtcars$am = as.factor(mtcars$am)
levels(mtcars$am) = c("AT", "MT")
aggregate(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars, mean)
atmpg <- mtcars[mtcars$am == "AT",]
mtmpg <- mtcars[mtcars$am == "MT",]
LM <- lm(mpg~factor(am), mtcars)
t.test(atmpg$mpg, mtmpg$mpg)

```
The Linear regression presents that, Manual Transmission have a better development of 7.76 miles more than Automatic Transmissions.
Running the T-test, it results in a p-value of 0.001374 a value off from the interval of confidence, considering the alternative hypothesis
that, the difference between the means is not equal to 0. Confirm that Manual Transmissions yields a better consumption of gas than automatic transmission.

#PLOTS
```{r plot, echo = TRUE}

qplot(mpg, data=mtcars, geom="density", fill=am, alpha= I(.5), main= "Distribution of Gas milage by Transmision - density", xlab="Miles per Gallon",  ylab="Density")
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(mpg)) + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(.~am) + labs(x = "Miles per Gallon", y = "Frequency", title = "MPG Histogram for AT and MT cars")
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(am, mpg)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x="Transmission", y = "MPG", title = "MPG: AT vs MT")

```

Answers:
1- Manual transmission can reach more miles per gallon
2- The total difference between AM and MT is 7.74 miles per gallon
